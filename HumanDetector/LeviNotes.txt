Emgu is not good, or at least its VideoCapture did not work on my cam properly. I had to wait 3 minutes on each startup for it to get my camera. Switched to OpenCVSharp and same code worked properly.

For some reason OpenCVSharp refuses to work with onnx files even tho as far as i can see i did everything correctly. (might be a code issue but it doesnt return any output in the array)
I spent 3h trying to find out why, i tested the models (onnx files) and they where correct and working when it was accessed from python. Might be an issue with the latest package ver.


TorchSharp only accepts TorchScript models, so it have to be converted https://docs.djl.ai/master/docs/pytorch/how_to_convert_your_model_to_torchscript.html



Work:

11.01 | 3h
11.04 | 8h
11.05 | 3h
