# C#-Learning
This repo is a collection of C# learning projects, note that this projects will containt code that does not follow best coding practices, since im testing functions and libraries to be more familiar with them.

First CLI calculator was made after 2 hours of reading C#, I have 0 knowledge of C# functions or overall how stuff work in C#, these projects are for learning porpuses.
This projects will not contain AI generated code to improve my overall searching and coding skills.
